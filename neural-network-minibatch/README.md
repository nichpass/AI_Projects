Neural Network

This project is a simple neural network implemented with minibatch gradient descent to predict the output values associated with the
'Digits' dataset in the scikit-learn library. The network is trained and has the weights and biases stored in respective files, giving
a prediction accuracy of about 96%, though new weights can be generated if the files are cleared.
