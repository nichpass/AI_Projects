# AI_Projects
## Projects involving artificial intelligence
There are 3 folders here that are all small projects:

`neural-network-minibatch` 
- This was my first neural net that I decided to code using just numpy (no TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) so that I could really understand the math behind it

`convolutional-net-TensorFlow-tutorial`
- This was a simply convolutional network I made using TensorFlow for classifying the MNIST dataset

`recurrent-net-tutorial-numPy`
- this is another neural net made using numpy that takes in a group of characters and tries to predict the next, thus learning an output that resembles English sentence structure (though it is all gibberish!)
